# Linux_Setup.sh
This program should remove most useless programs from Linux Mint Cinnamon. However this program is not perfect it does miss some programs sometimes. 

There is a method to the sudo madness.
If the program is run in sudo the ssh file system command creates a file only accessible through placing yourself as root. So do not run in sudo.

To-Do:
	User defined ssh: Allow user to change ssh and sshfs paths and usernames in a text file for the less experienced users. (Like that is actually possible lol)
	
Esthetics: Make it cleaner, better menu so on.
